"""Configuration loading: shared domain files + one environment file (local/dev/prod).

Why this layout:
- Domain files (cities, thresholds, DQ rules, model settings) are SHARED by all
  environments — the same definitions locally and in PROD.
- The environment file overrides only what really differs: where data lives and
  how much of it we process ("DEV/PROD differ only in variables").
- YAML ships inside the smogcast-core wheel (``smogcast/core/conf``), so a wheel
  deployed to Databricks carries exactly the configuration tested locally.
